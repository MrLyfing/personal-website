    "description": "Graduated from EPITA, a French engineering school in Paris, I was exposed to the Computer Science world throughout my studies and internships. With a strong interest in the web development, I committed myself to put my early career as a Front-End developer.\n\nI moved to the United States after my graduation where I started working in the Bay Area as a Front-End engineer for Heartflow, a medical software company which helps doctors to diagnose coronary artery disease for patients.\nA year later, I decided to start my new journey in Austin, Texas where I continue working for Heartflow.\n\nFamiliar with modern web technologies, I enjoy building hand-crafted website with a touch of personal aesthetic although my design skills are still limited. Performant, friendly user experience, responsiveness and browsers support are my primary focuses in delivering web applications for customers.\n\nIn the quest of seeking new challenges, I keep myself updated with the latest trends and upcoming news in relation to the World Wide Web.",
